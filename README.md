# -AI-Powered-Food-Calorie-Estimation-with-Vision-Language-Models-VLMs
This project involves developing a multimodal AI system that estimates the number of  calories in food images using vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP. Users can upload  an image of their meal, and the system will provide nutritional details, making it a valuable tool for  health-conscious individuals.
